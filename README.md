# A lightweight version of StreamMind for my Bachelor-Thesis

This sub-version uses:
- CLIP
- EMA
- Adaptive Threshold

Problem:
as visible in the results-file, this version fails to accurately detect events 
but instead the combination of llm calls and the detected events suggests that these events
were random hits
